🚀 Training an OCR Model for Nepali Handwriting Recognition 🇳🇵✍️
Recently, I worked on training an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) model to recognize handwritten Nepali text in google colab.
 The model is based on a CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network) architecture with CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) loss.
🔹 I used a custom dataset with over 4000 handwritten Nepali word images.
 🔹 Trained a deep learning model with attention mechanisms.
 🔹 Character set included vowels, consonants, ligatures, and special diacritics from the Nepali script.
✨ Results:
Achieved an average Character Error Rate (CER) of around 50%.
Word Error Rate (WER) was higher, but some simple words were predicted correctly.
Some examples had perfect matches, while complex compound words were more challenging.
🔥 Challenges:
Nepali script includes many complex ligatures and diacritic marks which are hard to segment and recognize.
Handwriting variability is large — different people write very differently.
Data augmentation and better pre-processing could further improve results.
🛠️ Next Steps:
Expand the dataset with more samples.
Improve the model with transformer layers or better attention mechanisms.
Tune preprocessing pipelines (adaptive thresholding, image normalization).
Train longer with better learning rate strategies.
🔍 Lessons Learned:
 Working with regional languages like Nepali in OCR is tough but exciting — it needs a mix of deep learning, NLP, and image processing skills.
 Still a long way to go, but I’m proud of the first milestone. 🚀
